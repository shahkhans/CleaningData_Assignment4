# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project - Peer Graded

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to COLLECT, WORK WITH, and CLEAN a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data whic can be used for later analysis

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   1. Download Data sets (as compressed zip file)
   2. Extract files from from compressed ZIP file
   3. Read Data sets into tables (data frames)
   4. Assign appropriate column names to tables using the ACTVITY LABELS and FEATURES
   5. Merge all TRAINING and TEST data
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   1. Search for column names that refer to "mean" or "std"
   2. Prepare a vector of all columns that provide mean and standard deviation
   3. Extract all measurements with the above columns
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. rom the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Write the Tidy Data set to a text file. 

The end result is shown in the file `tinyDataSorted.txt`
